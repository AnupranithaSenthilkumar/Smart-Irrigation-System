# Smart-Irrigation-System
This project leverages IoT technology to optimize agricultural water usage. It uses sensors to monitor soil moisture and temperature, sending real-time data to the Blynk mobile app for visualization. The system automates irrigation based on soil dryness, reducing manual intervention, conserving water, and promoting sustainable farming practices.
